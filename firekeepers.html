 <p>Bison are a beast of utmost importance to the Firekeepers. These great herds are the key to their very way of life, serving as a major source of food, clothing, and shelter. Their hides are made into great round tents, housing whole families on their journeys over the grasslands, while their horns are used to keep coals for fire-starting. This practice may have started as a mere means of survival, it has since become a matter of great religious significance. The fire kept in those horns symbolises the vitality of the tribes and hordes carrying them.</p>
