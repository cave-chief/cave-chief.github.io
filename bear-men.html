 </h1>
 <p>Huddled around fires in frozen caves, the Bear-men are widely regarded as a barbarous sort by more civilised men. These accusations are not entirely without merit, as it is common for Bear-man raiding parties to make expeditions into foreign lands when the winters are long and cold. It is said that the Mother Bear Arhitut, a widely worshipped goddess among the tribes, led their ancestors into the high mountains and hiemal hills thousands of years ago. Bear-man shamans chant and cry to appease the spirits of fire and frost sent in the summers and winters, performing cultic rites and sacrifices for their many tribal gods.</p>

 <p>Bear-men often wear the skins of the beasts they hunt. They believe that by wearing a beast's pelt some of its wild spirit is imbued within their own. Alongside the ritual reasoning it acts as a form of camouflage while hunting.</p>

 <p>Mammoth herds have been slowly decreasing in number over the past few generations. As such, mammoth hunters are held in high regard. The tusks and skins are usually gifted to elders and shamans or taken by great warriors and hunters.</p>

 <h2 align="CENTER">The Axe of Alamut<br>

 </h2>
 <p>Alamut was a Bear-man of great renown, chief of the tribes of Ukho. He led a band of hunters and raiders into the heart of the riverlands of the Palatials. They laid waste to their townlands and, perhaps more significantly, brought the art of metallurgy to the Bear-men. Alamut's axe was taken from the workshop of the king of Idir, a northern Palatial city-state. Ukhite chiefs continue to use Alamut's axe as a symbol of their right to rule.
