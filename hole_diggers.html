 </h1>
 <p>Small and bug-eyed, the Hole Diggers rarely interact with the wider world. Most men view them as something of an enigma, struggling to converse with or classify them. The few attempts at establishing trade or relations with them have gone largely unsuccessful, but they are not particularly aggressive. They do not appear to speak a human language, some describing their speech as "like the screeching of bats". Most men know to steer clear of their territory, as despite their stature, they are quite fierce and clever fighters. They are quite populous and well-armed, possessing a knowledge of the metallurgic arts surpassing even that of the Palatials. Hole Digger metalwork is highly valued, but extremely rare.</p>
