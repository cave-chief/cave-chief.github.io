 </h1>
 <p>The Man Eaters of the mountains were once spoken of in hushed tones by true men. They are hunters by night, stalking all manner of creature. Strong and hairy brutes, it is an insult to even call them human. They are half-beasts, speaking in nasal growls and snorts. Once, they were man's worst enemy, but the tides have since turned. These beasts stand little chance against Palatial charioteers, mounted Firekeeper archers, or even Bear-man warriors. Man Eaters have taken to hiding from the daylight, nowadays only hunting unarmed passers-by.</p>
