 </h1>
 <p>The Man Eaters of the mountains were once spoken of in hushed tones by true men. They are hunters by night, stalking all manner of creature. Strong and hairy brutes, it is an insult to even call them human, they are half-beasts, speaking in nasal growls and snorts. Curiously, they seem to revere eagles and other raptors, capturing them and making use of their feathers and talons. Once, they were man's greatest fear, but the tides have since turned. These beasts stand little chance against Palatial charioteers, mounted Firekeeper archers, or even Bear-man warriors. These Man Eaters have taken to hiding from the daylight, nowadays only hunting unarmed passers-by, the weak and helpless.</p>
