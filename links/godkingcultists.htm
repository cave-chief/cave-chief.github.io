 <p>On the banks of the great rivers of the south lie great cities and the first true kings of this world. The God King Cultists believe they were the first blessed with cities and metallurgy, and their influence can be felt far beyond the walls of their riverside citadels and temples, their smaller settlements reaching to the foothills of the Bear-men's country and the littoral lands of the Fishers. Their records tell of the founding of the great cities and the men who built them. King lists and tales of legendary warriors become both historical records and calls to prayer, the burial mounds of long dead kings are made into holy sites for devout pilgrims. Karam is the greatest of their cities, and it is said to be the oldest in the world.</p>
