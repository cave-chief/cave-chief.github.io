 </h1>
 <p>Small and nimble, the Hole Diggers rarely interact with the wider world. Most men view them as something of an enigma, struggling to converse with or classify them. The few attempts at establishing trade or relations with them have gone largely unsuccessful. They do not appear to speak in a recognisable language, some describing their speech as "like the screeching of bats", although this is something of an exaggeration. Most men know to steer clear of their territory, as despite their stature, they are quite fierce fighters, and appear to be well armed and highly numbered.</p>
