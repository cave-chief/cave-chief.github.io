 <p>Bison are beasts of great importance to the Firekeepers, as each part of the animal is useful. Their meat is for eating, pelts for clothing and shelter, and the horns have great ritual importance. The horns of bison are hollowed out, used for carrying fire on their long journeys across the steppe and plains.</p>
